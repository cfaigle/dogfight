Based on my analysis of the code, I'll implement a progressive difficulty system for enemy planes 
     that improves as waves increase. Here's my plan: 
 
      1. Modify the enemy_plane.gd script to incorporate wave-based difficulty scaling 
      2. Adjust several key parameters that affect enemy AI performance: 
         - Increase accuracy (reduce aiming error) 
         - Improve reaction time (faster response to player movements) 
         - Enhance evasion capabilities (better ability to dodge player attacks) 
         - Increase aggression (closer pursuit distances) 
         - Improve gunnery (tighter trigger discipline) 
 
      3. The difficulty will scale gradually with each wave, making enemies progressively more 
         challenging. 
 
     This will make the game more engaging as players advance through waves, with enemies becoming 
     smarter and more challenging to defeat.
