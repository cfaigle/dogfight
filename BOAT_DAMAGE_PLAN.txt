   Plan for Implementing Boat Damage System

   Overview
   I'll create a BoatDamageableObject class that extends the BaseDamageableObject similar to how
   BuildingDamageableObject works, but with boat-specific damage effects and debris.

   Implementation Steps

    1. Create BoatDamageableObject class:
       - Extend BaseDamageableObject like BuildingDamageableObject does
       - Implement boat-specific _apply_damaged_effects(), _apply_ruined_effects(), and
         _apply_destroyed_effects() methods
       - Add boat-specific debris generation in _generate_boat_debris() method

    2. Modify BoatGenerator to use damageable boats:
       - Update _create_stylized_boat_with_style() to add collision and damage capability to boats
       - Create BoatDamageableObject instances and attach them to boats
       - Set appropriate health values based on boat type

    3. Add boat-specific damage configurations:
       - Add a "Boat" object set to the damage manager configuration
       - Define appropriate health ranges, visual effects, and debris for boats

    4. Implement boat-specific visual effects:
       - Create water splash effects when boats are damaged/destroyed
       - Add sinking animation for destroyed boats
       - Modify materials to show water damage and sinking

    5. Test the implementation:
       - Verify boats can take damage and show appropriate effects
       - Ensure boats properly sink and generate debris when destroyed
       - Test that the damage system integrates with the existing weapon systems

   This approach follows the established patterns in the codebase while adding boat-specific
   functionality for a more immersive experience.
