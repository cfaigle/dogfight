Implementation Plan: Full Geometry Destruction with Permanent Removal
Phase 1: Activate Existing Visual/Audio Systems (Critical)
- Implement the empty _apply_visual_effects(), _apply_audio_effects(), and _apply_geometry_changes() methods in DamageManager
- Connect VisualAudioEffectsSystem to damage pipeline
- Ensure particle effects and sounds trigger at each destruction stage
Phase 2: Implement Real Geometry Destruction
- Mesh Fracturing: Break building meshes into pieces using Voronoi fracture patterns
- Debris Physics: Spawn rigid body pieces with appropriate physics properties
- Progressive Collapse: Buildings break apart realistically over multiple stages
- Material Transitions: Dynamic crack textures, fire effects, structural damage
Phase 3: Advanced Destruction Features
- Weapon-Specific Damage: Different damage multipliers for bullets vs missiles
- Chain Reactions: Explosions damage nearby structures
- Performance Optimization: Debris cleanup, LOD for destruction
Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
- Enhanced particle effects for each material type
- Destructible sound propagation
- Impact camera shake integration
- Performance monitoring and tuning

Technical Implementation Details
Key Files to Modify:
- scripts/managers/damage_manager.gd - Fill in empty effect methods
- scripts/systems/visual_audio_effects_system.gd - Integrate with damage pipeline  
- scripts/objects/building_damageable_object.gd - Enhanced destruction logic
- scripts/components/damageable_component.gd - Physics-based destruction
New Systems Needed:
- Mesh fracture utility for breaking apart geometry
- Debris spawner with physics properties
- Material transition system for progressive damage
- Performance-managed particle/audio coordination
This approach will give you dramatic, satisfying building destruction with permanent removal, making the combat feel impactful while maintaining the excellent architecture already in place.
